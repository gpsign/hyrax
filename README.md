# Hyrax 
**My personal collection of utility functions and hooks for TypeScript & React**  

Hyrax is a small library I built for myself to make my life easier when working with TypeScript and React. Itâ€™s a grab bag of utility functions and custom hooks that I find useful across different projects. Instead of rewriting the same logic over and over, I decided to bundle them up into this little package.  

## Why? ðŸ¤”  
I got tired of copy-pasting the same helper functions and hooks across projects, so I put them all in one place. Now, I can just install Hyrax and get back to coding without the extra hassle.  

## What's Inside? ðŸ“¦  
- Handy utility functions  
- Custom React hooks I use all the time  
- A little bit of everything to speed up development  
- Nothing fancyâ€”just things that I personally find useful  

This isnâ€™t meant to be a polished, production-ready libraryâ€”itâ€™s just my personal toolkit.
